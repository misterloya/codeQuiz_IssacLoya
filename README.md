<p> As users make their way to the URL, they're given instructions on how this Code Quiz Works
    They can either start the quiz immediately, or view the high score. Immediately after selecting 
    to start the quiz, they're presented with questions related to coding. If they answer a question
    correctly from a set of multiple choice questions, they are shown a "correct" sign. If they answer incorrectly 
    they are shown a "wrong" sign, and 10 seconds are taken off of a 60 second timer that's counting down 
    to zero. After the quiz is completed, or if time runs out, the user is presented with their score, 
    and the opportunity to enter their initials. Once their initials are input, they are displayed
    on the screen listed next to their initials. </p>
